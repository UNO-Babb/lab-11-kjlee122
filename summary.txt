I adjusted:
Item amount, 1-100
Shopping time, dividing total items by integers 1-4
The other data I chose to process was total shoppers
What I learned from this simulation is sometimes more is not better and only increases idle time
I chose to process total shoppers in order to see if there was a potential ideal ratio between shoppers and checkers.
